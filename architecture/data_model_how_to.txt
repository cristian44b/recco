Our proposal to meet the RECCoâ€™s Service & Governance requirements involves a comprehensive approach to designing, implementing, and maintaining the data model. The logical data model will be developed to cover the full solution scope, ensuring that all data entities relevant to the business are identified and documented. This includes detailing the relationships between entities and their cardinalities, which will highlight how data objects interact and relate to one another. The model will incorporate properties such as business descriptions, data classifications, confidentiality, ownership, and governance to ensure alignment with business requirements and data management best practices. By structuring the data model around these principles, we can provide a unified view of the data that reflects both current business needs and future scalability.

In the implementation phase, the logical data model will serve as a blueprint for creating a physical data model that can be deployed in the existing infrastructure. This approach allows for straightforward conversion of different data formats, for consistency across data sources. Regular reviews and updates to the data model will be scheduled to accommodate evolving business requirements and to maintain its relevance. By engaging business analysts and subject matter experts in the validation and refinement process, we will ensure that the data model remains accurate, comprehensive, and aligned with the organization's objectives.
